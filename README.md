The aim of ClassVista (E-Learning Management System) is to expand
boundaries of education service delivery with the help of an online platform. It
is easy to manage study materials, student information, and processes related to
payment and offers separate portals for Educators (Admins) and Students (Users).
Besides, reports like sales summary and payment status as well as daily operations
like course management and payments can be administered in a single day.

On the other hand, students can search for and register for courses, view ma-
terials they pay for, and leave feedback to enhance the course thus changing the

aspect of learning for the better. This project is about providing educators and
learners with a driving force and an intuitive solution between where every single
aspect of the teaching-learning process is within reach. This simply guarantees
not only better access to education for allbut also effectiveness and better quality.
